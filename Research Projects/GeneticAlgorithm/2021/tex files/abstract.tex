\abstract{
The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has seen many mutations since it was first reported on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan China. Our primary research objective is to provide a representation of one of its variants, the deltacoronavirus and put it in a gene map known as \emph{Phylogenetic Time Trees}. Our focus is to use a novel method in building distance matrices from a metaheuristic called the \emph{Genetic algorithm}. This algorithm is inspired by Charles Darwin's Natural Selection and it is very strong in navigating through massive search spaces. It finds optimal solutions to combinatronic problems that take a lifetime to compute. Using genome data offered by the National Center of Bioinformatics Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/coronavirus/genomes/), we build a time tree of this Coronavirus variant. \\
