GENETIC ALGORITHM
-----------------
The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has seen many mutations since it was first reported on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan China. Our primary research objective is to provide a representation of one of its variants, the deltacoronavirus and put it in a gene map known as Phylogenetic Time Trees. Our focus is to use a novel method in building distance matrices from a metaheuristic called the Genetic algorithm. This algorithm is inspired by Charles Darwin's Natural Selection and it is very strong in navigating through massive search spaces. It finds optimal solutions to combinatronic problems that take a lifetime to compute. Using genome data offered by the National Center of Bioinformatics Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/coronavirus/genomes/), we build a time tree of this Coronavirus variant.
