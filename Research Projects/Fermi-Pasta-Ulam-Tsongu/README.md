# Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou

The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem in physics is an apparent paradox that given a system of point masses connected by springs, it will almost exactly form the same periodic behavior known as the Ferma-Pasta-Ulam- Tsingou recurrence, rather than an expected ergodic behaviour. This behaviour came by surprise because they expected the system to thermalize or reach thermal equilibrium in just a short amount of time. Yet the system appears to evade the ergodic hypothesis and this explanation remains a hot topic in research today. Therefore, in this project we are building a numerical analysis program that will help us visualize linear and nonlinear forms of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem, to help us visualize this unique behaviour.
