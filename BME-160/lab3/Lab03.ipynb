You can do all of your work from within jupyter, then copy/paste your program to a new text file using your favorite text editor or python IDE. Test that program file !! On Mac systems you will use terminal, and on windows systems you will likely use cmd. You will then navigate to the directory where your proteinParam.py lives, then execute: <br>\n",

    "This method is to return a dictionary keyed by single letter Amino acid code, and having associated values that are the counts of those amino acids in the sequence. Make sure to include all 20 amino acids.  Proper amino acids that are not represented in the sequence should have a value of zero.

I have marked it with the single _ notation to advise future users of the class that this is not part of the defined interface and it just might change.\n",

    "The theoretical isolelectric point can be estimated by finding the  particular pH that yields a neutral net Charge (close to 0). There are a few ways of doing this, but the simplest might be to iterate over all pH values to find the one that is closest to 0. Doing this by hand is painful, but its not that bad to do computationally.  Remember that we want to find the  best pH, accurate to 2 decimal places.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way of doing the pI calculation would use a binary search over the pH range. This works because we expect a single zero crossing to exist in the range, and the function will be well behaved across the range of charge() as a function of pH (0-14 range). You then make the algorithm operate to any specified precision using an optional parameter (set the default parameter: precision = 2).\n",

It is useful to have an estimation of this coefficient for measuring a protein with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 280nm. It has been shown by Gill and von Hippel that it is possible to estimate the molar extinction coefficient of a protein from knowledge of its amino acid composition alone. From the molar extinction coefficient of tyrosine, tryptophan and cystine at a given wavelength, the extinction coefficient of the native protein in water can be computed using the following equation.\n",

    "# ProteinParam Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment definitely took a giant leap in difficulty. I am glad to finally be thinking about the problems. In terms of how I was able to save data attributes within an object was easy. I simply just took the constructor and made self.\\<variables\\> that could be accessed across the program. Now that we have a list of variables that are accessible across the class we can utlize the sequence and the dictionary which I thought were the two most important data attributes in this assignment. The charges method was implemented through for loops. As a mathematician, I have done some numerical problems where we would run math equations through code. From then I have taken some previous knowledge to appropriatley calculate the summations for each positive and negative charges. The pI method also required previous knowledge of numpy arrays. I know I could also run a for loop but numpy is well known for its speeds and I could save all the numbers into a list and perform a quick lookup to find its smallest value. The nice thing about my numpy array was that the index correlated with the pH as long as you multipled 0.1 to it. For example in the example user input my pI was at index 988 which meant that I know that the pH is 9.88. I was able to calculate massExtinction because we are able to call functions within a class. So using the molecular weight and molarExtinction we could easily calculate the methods. The dictionaries I used them as a sort of lookup table to represent membership. If a key matched the user input then I could access its corresponding value to perform a computation or allow it to go through an if statement. Overall this lab was fun because it was hard. I definitely had to think more which is a great part of programming and I can't wait for the next few assignments."

    "Cambell (1/24) Overall, all of Simon's code works and he has all the proper docstrings, as well as a good amount of comments as well. Since all of his code works, I am going to comment more on the design of the code. The code is neat and seems pretty efficient. He makes sure that if there is a big loop or method that needs to get run, that it only gets run once. If he were to call the method charge twice in the pI function, it would be way less efficient. Lastly, he constructs the aaComp dictionary more efficiently than me. He just uses the keys of the dictionary that contains the molecular weight, as to not have to construct the whole dictionary from scratch. "

    "Jonathan (Jan 24) - Simon's code is unique because, while it is more advanced than my inspections can contribute towards, it is still relatively easy to understand what's going on. For example, in the molarExtinction method, Simon not only explains what molar extinction is, but explicitly writes out the equation used to calculate. As an inspector, this is extremely helpful, because I can superimpose the equation onto his code and decipher exactly what each label stands for. His code runs without error and produces the desired output. Everything looks great!"
