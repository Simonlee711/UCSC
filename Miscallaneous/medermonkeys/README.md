PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
Meder Monkeys is a dice drinking game invented by yours truly. The rules are simple:
You will first enter an x amount of players and then you will roll a pair of dice.
If you roll an 8 < x (8 or higher) you will drink. You can also drink if you roll a
double five (monkey eyes) or a double one (snake eyes). Rules are simple, have fun 
and monkey on.
