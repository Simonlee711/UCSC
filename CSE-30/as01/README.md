PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
PERCENTAGE ALGORITHM:
This program will read in a user input or a dataset containing a sequence of
DNA. ex) AAGCTCGCGCGT. For this particular program we will be calcultating the
percentage of how many C's and G's are in this program. To do so I will be
implementing a counter for C's and G's, a counter for total characters in DNA
strand and put it into an equation like this:

                                               # of C's and G's
                  Percentage Calculated by: ---------------------- * 100
                                            Total # in DNA Strand

By doing so we should get a percentage going up to 6 decimal points.

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM
------------------
Try running these datasets or simply run from standard input. I recommend using
Python IDLE of any version 3.0 and better and for the sake of all other codes, I
highly recommend getting atleast Python3.9 or better. Datasets will be included
once I have uploaded everything else.

Try e.g.
python3 assignment_01.py <<<GATTACA
python3 assignment_01.py </sars-cov-2.txt         
python3 assignment_01.py </brca1.txt         
python3 assignment_01.py </chromosome4.txt         
python3 assignment_01.py </chromosome11.txt         
python3 assignment_01.py </joyce-finnegans-wake.txt
