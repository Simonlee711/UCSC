Lab Description
---------------
Lab1 which is an introductory level Lab using MMLogic Software. In this Lab
We had to make circuits for three different parts (A,B,C). Part A's objective was
To turn on a 7 segment display. Part B's objective was to make a circuit based off a truth
Table with 4 inputs and 3 outputs. Lastly Part C's objective was to make three separate circuits 
For a given truth table using either POS or SOP, SOP or POS using only NAND Gates, & SOP or POS only using NOR Gates. I used SOP through all three circuits and was able to match the truth table in all 3 circuits using the SOP, NAND and NOR operations

How to Run Program
-------------------
On page 1 of the Lab.lgi there are 4 switches under the input category and to be able to test
The individual circuits you can flip the switch ON (Boolean value = 1) or OFF (Boolean Value 0). Since there are only one set of switches, you must look at each Part of the Lab individually. More 
Comments to describe what is happening in the circuits are placed on the pages where the actual
Circuits are actually made.
