Lab 3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

-----------------------
DESCRIPTION
-This lab is an introduction to MIPS assembly language using the MARS IDE. The objective of the lab is to take a user input and convert that user input into a Triangle with (n-1) asterisk's on both the left and right sides. Example: * 2 *. The spaces in between are tabs, and it implements multiple branch functions to simulate the for loop in a higher level programming language. We also learn ti familiarize with syscalls to get certain things accomplished like: printing integers, reading integers, printing strings etc. Overall we study the fundamental structure to computer architecture and get a hands on experience on how technical a lower level programming language is like MIPS assembly.

INSTRUCTIONS

As previously mentioned this program is run on (MARS). Once you've opened up the file you can run the program by first assembling the program, then running it. You will only be asked to put in an input value that is greater than 0 then you should expect some sort of result.
